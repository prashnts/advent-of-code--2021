# Advent of Code -- 2021

> My attempts at solving the Advent of Code challenges.

This is just a code dump. Let's see how far do I make it.

## Running

- Most of the time I attempt to only use the stdlib of Python.
- Use `python 3.9` or above (should still work on lower, but not tested.)

## Contributing

There are better attempts at this, so I don't see why anyone would want to contribute something here... But in any case, feel free!
